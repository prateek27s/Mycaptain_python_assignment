# Q1. write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and computes area.
import math
radius= float(input("Input the radius of circle: "))
area= math.pi*radius*radius
print(f"The area of circle with radius {radius} is: {area}")


# Q2. write a Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.
filename=input("Input the filename:")
name,extension=filename.split('.')
print(f"The extension of the file: {extension}") 
# f is the formatted string used to add values when code runs and it display the value entered by user
